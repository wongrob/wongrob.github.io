This is the inaugural post to my blog. I do not have a plan for how frequently I will write a blog post yet. This is one of multiple hobbies I am currently pursuing along with my full time job, so consistency might be difficult, but I will do my best.

## About Me
I am currently a software engineer working on infrastructure security and isolation. My main interests in technology include security and networking, and I am very interested in the future of autonomous vehicles, although recently I have found the advancements in AI very interesting and controversial. I have a bachelorâ€™s degree in Computer Engineering and have a few published papers from research I participated in during college.
I also have other hobbies such as: I enjoy reading, playing video games, playing Dungeons & Dragons, watching anime, 3D printing, and playing ultimate frisbee. I also find personal finances, minimalism, productivity, and other topics interesting.

## What will this blog be about?
I plan on discussing various topics I find interesting on this blog. I will occasionally be discussing my work, although not in too much detail, and current events and topics in the technology industry. I also plan on discussing some of my other hobbies and interests from time to time. I do not believe that I am an expert on any of these topics, but hope that my insight and opinions might be interesting to some readers.
