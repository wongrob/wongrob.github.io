Imagine you get into a car, but not into the driver’s seat. Well, it might be the seat that is typically the driver’s seat, but there is no steering wheel, gas or brake pedal, mirrors, and many other components that are requirements for driving a vehicle. You no longer have to focus on the road and other cars for your morning and evening commute to and from work. You don’t have to worry about what other drivers are going to do, or get upset when another driver does something frustrating. Driving no longer contributes to tens of thousands of deaths a year. You don’t have to worry about maintenance costs or storage space of owning a car. Decreases in commute time, efficiency, and emissions. All of these are something that can be dreamed of, but are they realistic?

## A quick introduction to vehicle autonomy
The Society of Autonomous Engineers (SAE) defines 6 levels of autonomy ranging from 0 to 5. Level 0 is where there is no driver assistance and level 5 is where the driver no longer drives and the vehicle is completely autonomous. Below is a helpful infographic for understanding the levels of autonomy<sup>[1]</sup>.

The pursuit of autonomous vehicles has been an interest since the early 2000’s. It brings the promise of no longer having to own a car, reduced emissions, and safer travel and roads, however some of these promises are more controversial than others. Since the idea of autonomous vehicles was first explored, there have been many advancements thanks to improving technology, especially the improvements in AI. However, this post isn’t about the history and development of autonomous vehicles, but the current state and my thoughts. If you are interested in reading more about the history of autonomous vehicles, I recommend reading Autonomy: The quest to build the driverless car – and how it will reshape our world by Lawrence D. Burns and Christopher Shulgan<sup>[2]</sup>.

## Current technology and companies
The companies most commonly known include Waymo and Cruise, and recently the news on the two companies hasn’t been very promising given that Cruise and suspended operations across the US and Waymo has paused expansion in California. Waymo is a subsidiary of Alphabet (parent company of Google), while Cruise is a subsidiary of General Motors. However, there are other car companies with interests in autonomous vehicles such as the most well-known one: Tesla. There are other companies that are less well-known such as Zoox and Aurora which are also working on similar technologies.

Regarding technology, LiDAR is currently the one of the main technologies used by autonomous vehicles for navigating the road and traffic. LiDAR stands for Light Detection and Ranging and uses light and sensors to map the surroundings, much as the name implies. The two main companies I know that are working on LiDAR technology are Luminar Technologies, and Ouster which merged with Velodyne in 2023.

We can discuss further autonomous vehicle technologies. Another application is for trucking and delivery which uses similar technology, but applied to larger transportation such as semi-trucks. We can even further discuss other delivery technology such as drone delivery, however that is more different and I am not as familiar with the technologies used there.

## My personal controversial opinions

### Tesla
Let’s start with probably one of the most well-known related companies: Tesla. First off, I should say I do not own a Tesla, I have ridden in one though, but not with Tesla’s “FSD” in operation. I have seen videos of people using it, but I don’t think that is enough for me to go off entirely, so take what I say here with a grain of salt.

I think that Tesla has done great things by pioneering an affordable electric vehicle, and I think they are still doing great things by continuing to expand electric charging infrastructure, continuing to improve technologies and continuing to improve affordability of electric vehicles. I also think that they are doing a good job at driving competitions to improve driver assistance technology, but that is all that it is, it is not a fully autonomous vehicle. But not just to get on Tesla’s case, I don’t think there exists a fully autonomous vehicle yet, I don’t think we can consider one fully autonomous until we know that it can operate in all conditions, on all roads/streets/locations, and in all kinds of possible situations, and we just aren’t there yet. I don’t know when we will be there, but I don’t think you can call the technology Tesla is offering a fully autonomous self-driving car.

### Safety
Let’s start with the issue that is probably at the forefront of everybody’s mind since it is the issue that most commonly reaches the news. Are autonomous vehicles safe? The simple answer is no. We’ve seen the news and the reports of accidents caused by autonomous vehicles, as well as the concerns that emergency responders have with them, and with all that anecdotal evidence, it is hard to say that autonomous vehicles are safe.

First, let’s talk about an ideal world. In the ideal world, all vehicles on the road are autonomous, which would make them predictable, and predictable actions will make driving safer. A further ideal would be autonomous connected vehicles. In this world vehicles would communicate with each other, sharing information about intended actions, positioning and other details which would make traffic more efficient and safer. However, there are other concerns with this technology such as privacy and security.

One area where it is more likely to improve safety is in trucking. Now, I have never driven a semi-truck, and I don’t have any experience, but from my understanding, a lot of times truckers have to drive for long hours while getting little rest. On top of that, these semis are huge and can be fatal if they get into an accident with regular sized cars. Now, putting these ideals aside, we can talk realistically.

According to an article from the San Francisco Chronicle in 2023, there were a total of 270 self-reported autonomous vehicle accidents in San Francisco<sup>[3]</sup>, which isn’t very promising for the safety of them. However, I would say that it is hard to know how this compares to human drivers. For one, we do not know how many of these accidents/incidents are caused by autonomous vehicles and how many of these are caused by humans and human drivers. Additionally, we don’t have equivalent information to compare the data between autonomous vehicles and human drivers. I am not saying this to defend autonomous vehicles, but instead to say that it is uncertain whether we can say they are safer than human drivers or not.

On the other hand, technology improves, such is the case with autonomous vehicles as well. According to the San Francisco Chronicle, there have been declines in driverless vehicle incidents<sup>[4]</sup>. Maybe we will reach the ideal world eventually, but for now, it is too early to say.

### Emissions
Here is another controversial topic, how will autonomous vehicles improve carbon emissions? I don’t believe it will be significant enough to solve climate change, but I do believe it will have some impact.

Ride sharing services, taxis, public transportation; all of these help reduce the emissions of individual transportation. Car ownership itself is very inefficient with cars being parked 95% of the time<sup>[5]</sup>. As with most modern-day products, manufacturing cars produces carbon emissions and reducing the number of cars required would reduce carbon emissions. And I expect that we will continue to see growth in usage of ride-sharing services.

On the other hand, what about an autonomous vehicle you own? If you own the vehicle, you still have the downsides of having it take up space in your garage, maintenance costs, paying for fuel (although that is likely factored into the cost of a ride sharing equivalent), and similar negatives to vehicle ownership. However, if we look at the ideal world again where cars are communicating with each other, we can still see emission reductions. If cars could all communicate perfectly, we would no longer require infrastructure such as stop lights and stop signs, and one might even imagine an ideal where cars perform a perfect dance where they don’t have to stop improving efficiency as well. But again, this is all just an ideal, and at this point, I don’t think it should be a factor. However, this doesn’t mean we should stop researching the technology, because one day, maybe we can reach this ideal.

Since we’re on the topic of emissions, I want to also briefly touch on electric vehicles. I will probably talk in more detail about this in a future post, but since I think that electric vehicle and autonomous vehicle technology will work to benefit each other, we should discuss it a bit here. While electric vehicles do use energy a lot more efficiently, we have to remember that currently a lot of our electricity is still generated by fossil fuels. And yes, cars use fuel very inefficiently, so we are definitely still benefiting from electric vehicles and a centralized power station, but we still need to also increase green energy production, then we can argue a much greater point on the reduction in emissions, although this isn’t only with respect to electric vehicles but electricity in general.

I think that something else we need to mention though is tire wear. Due to the nature of electric vehicles being heavier than the ICE (internal combustion engine) counterparts, tires wear more and faster, and the wear of the tires also made from fossil fuel causes pollution as well. We don’t see much improvements in tire pollution due to the lack of publicity, which is why I believe it is important to mention. Additionally, I think there are some arguments that tire pollution is a different type of emissions than exhaust which is carbon dioxide emission, a greenhouse gas contributing to climate change, and since tire pollution is different, it is not as important. I don’t buy it, tire pollution still causes releases of microplastics which might not contribute directly to greenhouse gasses, but definitely are an important pollution we need to deal with as well. Anyways, I said I would touch briefly on electric vehicles, but this rant has grown long, so let’s continue.

### Consumer Improvement
Sure, there are alternatives such as Uber and Lyft that work similarly. But one nice thing about your own car (or your own autonomous vehicle) is that you don’t have to share with anybody. Sometimes it is awkward to sit in the back of someone else’s car while they are driving you, maybe not talking, or maybe you don’t want to talk to them. Then there is also sometimes their music playing, or the radio on, or maybe it is dead silent. And I’m not saying that the drivers or riders are at fault here, but if you were in your own vehicle, you would have more control over that, such as in the case if you were in your own autonomous vehicle, just you and the car.

I think for me and most people, one of the most promising results of autonomous vehicles is saving time. All of those hours of commuting to and from work, or on long road trips, or just driving in general, could be saved if you no longer had to drive! During that extra time, you could sleep, work, watch videos or movies, or my favorite: read books. But with commute times taking a large percentage of our productive time, being able to perform other activities in that time would increase productivity. Maybe I’m just saying this because I live in a country that greatly favors individual personal vehicles as the main mode of transportation.

### Alternative Transportation
Finally, I want to talk about the main proponents of cars and car ownership in general: public transportation, walking, and biking (or scootering/skating/whatever else you want to do). I agree, I love the idea of public transportation, and depending on where you live, it might be a great alternative. But, in a lot of the United States at least, public transportation infrastructure is just not there, and neither is cyclist infrastructure. Where I grew up, there were bus routes, but generally they were very inconvenient for me, in the form that I would have to travel a quarter to a half of a mile, and then the buses ran only every hour. On top of that, the buses weren’t well maintained. As for cycling, a lot of places have separate cyclist lanes, but where I lived, we didn’t even have sidewalks on many of the streets. Granted, these weren’t main streets, but these also weren’t in the countryside or removed from places you would want to walk around, I lived a block away from stores, but half the distance didn’t have sidewalks. In the end, I think that public transportation and other forms of transportation infrastructure would be great, but right now, we aren’t built for that and it would probably be difficult to get buy-in for supporting those new costs.

## Conclusion
Take my opinions and thoughts with a grain of salt. They are exactly what they are, my opinions and thoughts, but I think this is an interesting topic given the current position we are in with the changes to the automotive industry. I still think that autonomous vehicles are very promising, and I can’t wait for the day that I can regularly take autonomous vehicles instead of having to call an Uber or drive myself. But what are your thoughts? I’d love to hear if you have any differing opinions or if you agree with my points.
