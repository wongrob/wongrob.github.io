Personally, I feel like both privacy and security have been increasingly more relevant and important in our modern day world. In the past, I think privacy and security were mostly at the forefront of people's minds if they were "paranoid" (rightfully so), but recently I think that more and more people are becoming aware of what their privacy and security actually means online. I want to write a post that descibes some privacy/security practices and tools that I use and/or want to start using in the future, but for now I want to discuss some recent incidents to motivate that post. I am also going to preface this with although I did study a bit of cybersecurity in college and I currently work in the area of security, I do not consider myself an expert in cybersecurity.

I think the first security vulnerability that I was aware of at the time of it being relevant was the major OpenSSL vulnerability around 2021. This was while I was still in college and just starting to learn about cybersecurity and I honestly don't remember too much about it. However, I think the incident that first seemed to attract a lot of attention from my perspective was the Microsoft Storm-0558 attack<sup>[1]</sup>. I recommend you give the report a read if you are at all interested, and while it includes a lot of technical details and terms that are a bit difficult even for me to understand, it is a great report. For those of you that don't want to read it, it very naively sums up to: the actors were able to steal an unused but still valid signing key that the actors were then able to use to forge valid tokens. Of the many different issues that aligned that the actors were able to make use of, I think one of the most important ones was the need for key hygiene and routine key rotation. Some of my first questions are along the lines of "why weren't keys distrusted when they were no longer used?", and while that is an important question, I think the answer to that is simply nobody thought of it at the time. I think a more important question to ask is "how can we fix this and prevent similar issues from arising in the future?" because in the end, you can't change the past. We need to take more caution when planning and building these systems out in the future, with a secure-by-design approach and there is continuous need to think about and improve our security practices, not as an afterthought.

In the past, a lot of the internet hadn't even used encryption. In fact, I'm sure there are still some places that store passwords and other data in plaintext. One particular instance, just in December of last year (about 4 months ago), the FBI warned that Chinese hackers are likely stealing unecnrypted data from telecommunication companies and particularly reading unencrypted SMS text messages<sup>[2]</sup>. However,  the Rich Communication Services (RCS) standard is set to include encryption now with both Google and Apple (two of the main implementors of RCS) planning on supporting it<sup>[3]</sup>. While Google's internal RCS implementation, Apple's iMessage, and many 3rd party messaging apps supported encryption, this is a huge win for an encryption standard for common usage, but I think it is another lesson that we need to design with security and privacy in mind. I personally use the default messaging app,  mostly out of convenience, which is not great for Android and Apple texting, but for the most part all of my friends and family have the same family of phone brand. So I understand that most people like me probably have a thought similar to "if I have nothing to hide, why should I care?". But I also believe in the principal that my data should remain secure and private. It's a smiliar concept as if someone could see you around your house at any time, while you might not have anything to hide, the possibility is still less than ideal. But we have been moving in the right direction in recent years, and I'm sure we'll continue to improve.

However, with the coming of quantum computing, we'll need to step up our security even further. Quantum computing is still a ways out, but once it becomes available, it has the capability of breaking existing cryptography and encryption. There is a lot of work to move towards post-quantum cryptography to future-proof encryption, but existing data that entities have collected will be broken by quantum computing in the future and they will have access to all of that data. All of this demonstrates the increasing importance of improving security and also how privacy improvements can come alongside security improvements.

I think governments have been helping us improve in terms of privacy and security. The United States has been becoming more interested in the security practices of technology companies with the Microsoft incident and other breaches that have affected government agencies and members<sup>[4]</sup>. In addition, the European Union has passed laws as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) that are a huge win for consumer privacy and security<sup>[5]</sup>. And although these laws apply solely to the EU, this will likely improve security and privacy for all users either as companies create the capability and are able to provide it to all users, or other countries follow suit with the laws there. The one area that we may be moving backwards is the recent request from the United Kingdom to build a backdoor into Apple's Advanced Data Protection (ADP)<sup>[6]</sup>. I'm not sure I understand the UK's approach at (secretly) requesting this backdoor and I definitely don't agree with it, but I think what Apple is doing to explicitly not allow a backdoor (which it has a history with<sup>[7]</sup>) is a positive for consumer privacy, even if it means UK's residents don't get access to ADP for now. In the end though, I think the idea that government are becoming more involved in regulating tech companies is important, but we need to continue to push them to do more.

Probably more relevant to most people in terms of security are scams, breaches, and identity theft. I, like I'm sure most people have, been receiving more scam texts and emails. Two of what I think are the most prevalent and probably effective smishing (SMS phishing) I've seen are attempting to emulate USPS<sup>[8]</sup> and toll roads<sup>[9]</sup>. Some of these messages have obvious errors that make them easy to recognize, and if you know what to look for and are careful you'll probably notice the strange link added. However, with the advances of AI, I think these forms of phishing (smishing, email phishing, etc.) will continue to become more advanced and harder for the common eye to recognize. Plus, receiving all of these spam messages are annoying to receive (I also hate all of the spam physical mail I receive). We need to improve methods to classify these attempts and do our best to prevent people from falling victim. But this is also one of the plus sides to AI. I am already aware of Gmail's automatic spam filtering<sup>[10]</sup> and Android's scam detection<sup>[11]</sup> and I'm sure we will see more with Apple Intelligence and other AI tools in the future. But we will have to continue to improve security practices to reduce and prevent scams, breaches, and identity theft in the future. In a future post I'll talk about some of the things I do and anyone can do to reduce their chances of being victims of scams, breaches, and/or identity theft.

One of the other areas that needs major improvement is the reporting of security news and events on media. I won't name the particular company I am thinking of, but on my online feed I see sensationalized articles about "urgent warning" and "important security update, must update now". While I understand that titles need to be sensationalized in order to get clicks for people to actually read, seeing this many feels like the boy who cried wolf. It feels like all of these are small things, but when important incidents arise, people are less aware. The worse side of it is when misinformation is spread. I don't mean to call out a particular article, and the original usage is from the paper itself, but a recent bluetooth "backdoor" was reported<sup>[12]</sup> which overexaggerated the actual findings <sup>[13]</sup>. On top of this, I think there is some difficulty with communicating the impact and importance of security to the general population, and I think there needs to be some improvement on this in the future. And this includes myself as I continute to try to improve on my writing skills through these blog posts.

All in all, we will probably continue to hear more about security and privacy in the coming years and as I have stated over and over again it will become more and more important for everybody to be aware and advocate for them. Although I am worried about what this might entail, I am also excited to work in this area and do my best to contribute to improvements in security. As I mentioned, I will work on another article about how to improve your personal privacy and security online in the future.
