A friend recently asked me for some anime recommendations, which is kind of surprising given that I only started watching anime relatively recently. I had first started watching anime over the pandemic, and ever since I have been hooked. I am half Japanese and I've always considered the culture to be somewhat integrated into my life such as the food and customs like taking your shoes off in houses, but I was never really integrated with Japanese pop culture before. Anyways, since I started recently, I have kept a pretty thorough documentation of the anime I have watched, and still remember it pretty well. I'm also not great on selling why you should try things, but if you're just looking for recommendations, trust me ðŸ˜‰. I have created a page for [my anime list](/animanga) (since I don't want another account to actually use [MyAnimeList](https://myanimelist.net)), and I also plan on adding more details for manga and light novels I have read as well. Anyways, here is what I currently recommend for anime, and for reference this is right after I have watched [Love Flops](https://myanimelist.net/anime/51403/Renai_Flops?q=love%20flops&cat=anime) (which by the way I would never recommend watching) from [my anime list](/animanga).

## Must watch
My current #1 recommendation that I think everyone should watch is [Frieren](https://myanimelist.net/anime/52991/Sousou_no_Frieren) since it is currently my all-time favorite anime, which I know is kind of cliche since it is currently #1 on MAL, but I truly believe it is outstanding and everybody should watch it. I would also have to recommend [Delicious in Dungeon](https://myanimelist.net/anime/52701/Dungeon_Meshi) which I think is similar to Frieren and I also love but am not as sold on the overarching plot, and [Oshi no Ko](https://myanimelist.net/anime/52034/Oshi_no_Ko) which I think is another top-tier anime, and quite possibly my all-time second favorite anime. Finally, I would recommend watching at least one of the following Makoto Shinkai anime movies: [Suzume](https://myanimelist.net/anime/50594/Suzume_no_Tojimari), which is more recent and very visually stunning, [Your Name](https://myanimelist.net/anime/50594/Suzume_no_Tojimari) which is older but a classic and an overall great story, or [Weathering with You](https://myanimelist.net/anime/38826/Tenki_no_Ko), which is personally my favorite of the three story-wise, but I don't think is as visually beautiful as the other two. All of Makoto Shinkai are great, and he has other movies that you should watch too, but of them I have only seen [5 Centimeters per Second](https://myanimelist.net/anime/1689/Byousoku_5_Centimeter) so far, and I would suggest starting with the three I previously mentioned.

Now those are my top recommendations for everyone, but I also have other recommendations based on the genre you are interested in.

## Bittersweet Romance
This is probably my favority genre/class of anime, which also means this (and/or the next category) will probably have the longest list of recommendations. Personally, I find this genre and romance hard to watch in live action, but love to watch it in anime because I feel like it is less "corny" or something. I also am mostly arbitrarily separating "bittersweet" from standard romance, but I think you would agree if you watched them. My all-time favorite in this category is [Plastic Memories](https://myanimelist.net/anime/27775/Plastic_Memories), which is somewhat surprising since it is original (not based on a novel or manga), but I love the overall story and I think the animation is pretty good. [Your Lie in April](https://myanimelist.net/anime/23273/Shigatsu_wa_Kimi_no_Uso) is also one of my favorite animes. My possibly all-time favorite anime movie is [I Want to Eat Your Pancreas](https://myanimelist.net/anime/36098/Kimi_no_Suizou_wo_Tabetai). Some other bittersweat animes are [WorldEnd](https://myanimelist.net/anime/33502/Shuumatsu_Nani_Shitemasu_ka_Isogashii_desu_ka_Sukutte_Moratte_Ii_desu_ka), [The Day I Became a God](https://myanimelist.net/anime/41930/Kamisama_ni_Natta_Hi), [Angel Beats](https://myanimelist.net/anime/6547/Angel_Beats), and [Charlotte](https://myanimelist.net/anime/6547/Angel_Beats), which I think are all great tear-jerkers and fairly short with only 1 season each. [Anohana](https://myanimelist.net/anime/9989/Ano_Hi_Mita_Hana_no_Namae_wo_Bokutachi_wa_Mada_Shiranai) (and the movie) is another good one, although I feel like it can be a bit cringy at some points. Finally, [Fuuka](https://myanimelist.net/anime/33743/Fuuka) is a good one that is also a "girl's band" anime (which could be a separate category altogether). However, this anime is different from the source material, which I haven't read yet, but really want to even though I was spoiled for the source material when looking to see if there may be another season, so be careful!

## Romance
Since I like romance anime (probably a little too much), I had to separate what I consider to be bittersweet, and regular romance into separate categories. [Blue Box](https://myanimelist.net/anime/57181/Ao_no_Hako) is definitely my top anime in this category, I love the animation and the story, which has been really good at combining a lot of different characters and stories without making it overly confusing (by jumping around a lot) or overwhelming (by including too much).  [Horimiya]() I think is really good, includes good humor, and also is a classic slice of life. [Violet Evergarden](https://myanimelist.net/anime/33352/Violet_Evergarden) (and the related movies) has a really sweet story, and I think the animation is really nice too. [A Silent Voice](https://myanimelist.net/anime/28851/Koe_no_Katachi) and [A Sign of Affection](https://myanimelist.net/anime/55866/Yubisaki_to_Renren) are also both really good, and also touch on disabilities which is interesting, with one being a little more saddening (but not quite bittersweet). [Toradora](https://myanimelist.net/anime/4224/Toradora) is pretty good, and so is [Oregairu](https://myanimelist.net/anime/14813/Yahari_Ore_no_Seishun_Love_Comedy_wa_Machigatteiru), but honestly I feel like they don't stand out as much. Similarly [The Ice Guy and His Cool Female Colleague](https://myanimelist.net/anime/52173/Koori_Zokusei_Danshi_to_Cool_na_Douryou_Joshi) feels slightly bland, but I like and recommend because it is a good more "adulty" romance. Finally, [Fruits Basket](https://myanimelist.net/anime/120/Fruits_Basket) is a classic, and was also the first manga I ever read, but mostly because I thought the books looked really cool.

## Action
[Demon Slayer](https://myanimelist.net/anime/38000/Kimetsu_no_Yaiba), [Jujutsu Kaisen](https://myanimelist.net/anime/40748/Jujutsu_Kaisen), [Attack on Titan](https://myanimelist.net/anime/16498/Shingeki_no_Kyojin), and [Chainsaw Man](https://myanimelist.net/anime/44511/Chainsaw_Man) are musts in this category if you haven't seen them already. [The Seven Deadly Sins](https://myanimelist.net/anime/23755/Nanatsu_no_Taizai) is also pretty good. And personally, [Sword Art Online](https://myanimelist.net/anime/11757/Sword_Art_Online) (and related movies but not the [Gun Gale Online](https://myanimelist.net/anime/36475/Sword_Art_Online_Alternative__Gun_Gale_Online) spinoff), which although I know is controversial, I have to add because this was truly the anime they really got me hooked on anime because I loved the overall plot even if some of the sub-stories weren't as great. Also, I think that the series is a lot better during and after the Alicization arc, and the Progressive movies are a lot better as well. [Gurren Lagann](https://myanimelist.net/anime/2001/Tengen_Toppa_Gurren_Lagann) is a bit older, but I think a good one. [Lycoris Recoil](https://myanimelist.net/anime/50709/Lycoris_Recoil) was also really good, and also an anime original, although the second season doesn't really fit with action (but is still good!). And finally, I'm tossing [Code Geass](https://myanimelist.net/anime/1575/Code_Geass__Hangyaku_no_Lelouch) (specifically the one focused on Lelouch) and [86](https://myanimelist.net/anime/41457/86) in here, which I think both are great animes and highly recommend and are both some of my favorites, but I'm not sure that they entirely fit in the action category, but I'm also not sure where else to add them. Oh yeah, and [Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood](https://myanimelist.net/anime/5114/Fullmetal_Alchemist__Brotherhood), but honestly I think it is a bit overhyped (hot take).

## Isekai (Reborn in Another World)
[That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime](https://myanimelist.net/anime/37430/Tensei_shitara_Slime_Datta_Ken) is my main recommendation here. I'll also include [Log Horizon](https://myanimelist.net/anime/17265/Log_Horizon) here, even though it is not quite an isekai but has a lot of similar aspects. It has great world building, but I was a bit disappointed in it because I wanted more plot related to the "isekai" portion of the story, which is why I think I enjoyed [Sword Art Online](https://myanimelist.net/anime/11757/Sword_Art_Online) more as a somewhat similar plot. I've heard there are good ones like [Re:Zero](https://myanimelist.net/anime/31240/Re_Zero_kara_Hajimeru_Isekai_Seikatsu), which I haven't watched yet and can't officially recommend, but I'm not sure because honestly I don't think I'm the biggest fan of isekai.

## Other
Now, here is a collection of animes I highly recommend, but I am not sure if they fall well into a category. All of these are really high on my list of all-time favorite animes (which I'm realizing is really long), which is why I needed to recommend them in one shape or another. [Steins;Gate](https://myanimelist.net/anime/9253/Steins_Gate) (and the related movie) is a really good anime, although a bit difficult to get into at first because of the complexity of time travel and the eccentricity of the main character, but stick with it because it gets really good. Another good time-travel related anime is [Erased](https://myanimelist.net/anime/31043/Boku_dake_ga_Inai_Machi) which includes a bit of a mystery (and some minor romance?), and another good one to watch is [The Girl Who Leapt Through Time](https://myanimelist.net/anime/2236/Toki_wo_Kakeru_Shoujo) which is cool original exploring an interesting take on avoiding transitioning to adulthood and deciding on your future. Another interesting anime exploring the transition to adulthood (aka puberty) is [Rascal Does Not Dream of Bunny Girl Senpai](https://myanimelist.net/anime/37450/Seishun_Buta_Yarou_wa_Bunny_Girl_Senpai_no_Yume_wo_Minai) (or the Rascal Does Not Dream of ... series and movies), which despite the interesting name is actually one of my favorite animes and definitely a recommend (I was surprised with the plot and how it was not related to the title).

If you're looking for a good sports anime, of course you have to watch [Haikyuu](https://myanimelist.net/anime/20583/Haikyuu), which I initially avoided because I was worried it was overhyped, but it was a really good anime. [Classroom of the Elite](https://myanimelist.net/anime/35507/Youkoso_Jitsuryoku_Shijou_Shugi_no_Kyoushitsu_e) is one of my favorite animes, mostly because of the main character's personality and the concept of the school they are at. [Death Note](https://myanimelist.net/anime/1535/Death_Note) is a classic, and I definitely recommend you give it a watch at some point. [Bottom-Tier Character Tomozaki](https://myanimelist.net/anime/40530/Jaku-Chara_Tomozaki-kun) is a good anime that is arguably romance, but honestly I think I just wish someone helped me be more popular. [DanDaDan](https://myanimelist.net/anime/57334/Dandadan) is a really good more recent anime, and is probably action, but because I feel like it is very unique, I didn't want to put it in the action section. And then [Food Wars](https://myanimelist.net/anime/28171/Shokugeki_no_Souma) is a tough one, which I have to recommend because I think the concept and plot are unique and great, but I wish included less exploding clothes...

Moving on, I discovered that I like "girl band" animes, which as I mentioned before could be it's own category. [Sound Euphonium](https://myanimelist.net/anime/27989/Hibike_Euphonium) (and the related movies including [Liz and the Blue Bird](https://myanimelist.net/anime/35677/Liz_to_Aoi_Tori)) is a great band anime, and I love the overall story throughout their high school, and I am happy that it is completed. [Bocchi the Rock](https://myanimelist.net/anime/47917/Bocchi_the_Rock) is also another great anime with great characters with not much else to say.

I'm also adding [2.5 Dimensional Seduction](https://myanimelist.net/anime/53802/25-jigen_no_Ririsa) and [My Dress-Up Darling](https://myanimelist.net/anime/48736/Sono_Bisque_Doll_wa_Koi_wo_Suru) here, which are pretty similar, and I didn't add to the romance section because they haven't really gotten to the romance part yet, but I know (at least am pretty sure) they will at some point.

## Adult
I find it very hard to find good animes where the main characters are adults (I'm including in college), since it seems like most animes are targeted for teens, so here are "adult" animes I have enjoyed, and please let me know if you know of any other good ones! [Bokutachi No Remake](https://myanimelist.net/anime/40904/Bokutachi_no_Remake) was one of my favorites when I first started binging anime, but I have been sad since it does not seem like they will ever come out with a season 2, and I still need to read the light novels. [Steins;Gate](https://myanimelist.net/anime/9253/Steins_Gate) (and all of the related other series/movies) is really good and is probably in my all-time top anime list as well, with a somewhat confusing/complex plot about time travel, I think it is written really well. Another good series is [Spice and Wolf](https://myanimelist.net/anime/2966/Ookami_to_Koushinryou), which I think both the old one and the new one are good and I don't quite consider it romance, but maybe it is there. [Rent-A-Girlfriend](https://myanimelist.net/anime/40839/Kanojo_Okarishimasu) falls here, but I can't recommend it as a good romance anime. I don't know if I quite recommend them, but [Death Parade](https://myanimelist.net/anime/28223/Death_Parade) and [Bartender: Glass of God](https://myanimelist.net/anime/53407/Bartender__Kami_no_Glass) were both pretty good also.

Some other ones that I think fall in this category, but I have already mentioned include (in no particular order): [Delicious in Dungeon](https://myanimelist.net/anime/52701/Dungeon_Meshi), [That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime](https://myanimelist.net/anime/37430/Tensei_shitara_Slime_Datta_Ken) (and related series/movies), [Violet Evergarden](https://myanimelist.net/anime/33352/Violet_Evergarden) (and the related movies), [Log Horizon](https://myanimelist.net/anime/17265/Log_Horizon), [Plastic Memories](https://myanimelist.net/anime/27775/Plastic_Memories), [The Seven Deadly Sins](https://myanimelist.net/anime/23755/Nanatsu_no_Taizai), and [A Sign of Affection](https://myanimelist.net/anime/55866/Yubisaki_to_Renren).

[Frieren](https://myanimelist.net/anime/52991/Sousou_no_Frieren) it is hard for me to add to this category since half the main characters are probably in their teens and the main character acts like a child. There may be more that could also fall into this category, but these are the ones that I feel are more "adulty".

## Slice of Life
Overall, I love slice of life, but personally I don't think it is a category, but more so a style of story telling. I actually think that almost all (maybe with the exception of action) of the animes and categories above could fall into "Slice of Life", so I'll leave this here saying check out all of the other categories for this category.

## Conclusion
But here is my (much longer than initially expected) list of current anime recommendations, and it is probably missing some animes still. I may make more posts in the future to update my recommendations, but I'll probably have the most up-to-date list of my favorites on [my anime list page](/animanga) page, and you can also check there for my ratings for anime I have watched. I may also add commentary for some of the animes as well. So check it out, and let me know what you liked, or if I missed (or haven't watched yet) something you would recommend!
