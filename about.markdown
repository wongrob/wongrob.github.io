Hello, my name is Robert, but I also often go by Robbie. I am currently a software engineer working in the area of infrastructure security. I have various interests and I expect that this website will grow to discuss many of my interests in the future. Currently I want to start up this website with a blog to discuss some topics I find interesting.
