## Welcome
This is my first "real" website, in the fact that it is a website I am creating solely because I want to. I decided to start this website to give me a little push to work on projects outside of work since I have some ideas but have been pushing off starting any of them. I also added a blog that I hope to occasionally document topics that I think are interesting or important. I do feel the need to note that anything on this website is my own opinion and does not represent the opinions of the company I work for. Also I am not an expert in anything and these are just ramblings from another software engineer. If you would like to leave any comments, please do so using the github repository hosting this site.
