## Educational Projects

### Meeting Manager

<a href="https://github.com/Nruano3/SPS-team4">Repository Link</a>

A web application for simplifying the process of scheduling meetings by allowing you to directly compare Google calendars. This was a month long team project for Google's Software Product Sprint (SPS) program to teach us about industry best standards and processes.

### Feedback Loop

<a href="https://github.com/CSCI-152/Team7Repo">Repository Link</a>

A web application built for streamlining feedback communication between professors and students. This was a 2 semester team project for Computer Science courses for teaching the complete process of Software Engineering. I have a video presentation on the project that I will \<insert here\> when/if I find a link to it.

### CAN Bus Arbitration ID ACL Filtration

An FPGA design prototyped on a development board that implements a hash table access control list on arbitration IDs designated in ISO 11898-1:2015 for filtering CAN bus frames. This was a partner course project to demonstrate our understanding of embedded systems. I will add documentation of the project and any source code \<insert here\> when/if I find them.

### Morse Code Translator with RSA Encryption/Decryption

Hardware-level digital system design of a binary-based Morse Code implementation with RSA encryption and decryption using Verilog. This was a parter course project to demonstrate our understanding of the digital logic design process. I will add documentation of the project and any artifacts \<insert here\> when/if I find them.

### DNS and DHCP Spoofing Emulation

Emulation of DNS and DHCP spoofing attacks over a network using virtual machine environments. This was a course project to demonstrate our understanding of security concepts. I will add documentation of the project and the video demonstration \<insert here\> when/if I find them.
